# Boxes

A box creates a visually distinct group of logically related information and components.

*Image description: A stylized representation of a group of interface elements within a rounded rectangle. The image is tinted red to subtly reflect the red in the original six-color Apple logo.*

By default, a box uses a visible border or background color to separate its contents from the rest of the interface. A box can also include a title.

## Best practices

**Prefer keeping a box relatively small in comparison with its containing view.** As a box’s size gets close to the size of the containing window or screen, it becomes less effective at communicating the separation of grouped content, and it can crowd other content.

**Consider using padding and alignment to communicate additional grouping within a box.** A box’s border is a distinct visual element — adding nested boxes to define subgroups can make your interface feel busy and constrained.

## Content

**Provide a succinct introductory title if it helps clarify the box’s contents.** The appearance of a box helps people understand that its contents are related, but it might make sense to provide more detail about the relationship. Also, a title can help VoiceOver users predict the content they encounter within the box.

**If you need a title, write a brief phrase that describes the contents.** Use sentence-style capitalization. Avoid ending punctuation unless you use a box in a settings pane, where you append a colon to the title.

## Platform considerations

*No additional considerations for visionOS. Not supported in tvOS or watchOS.*

### iOS, iPadOS

By default, iOS and iPadOS use the secondary and tertiary background [colors](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/color) in boxes.

### macOS

By default, macOS displays a box’s title above it.
